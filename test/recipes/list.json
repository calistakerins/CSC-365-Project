Add in the garlic and let it cook until soft and golden (you may need to lower the heat to keep it from browning too fast). Once the spaghetti is cooked drain it while reserving about 1 tablespoons of the starchy pasta water. Add the spaghetti to the pan with the oil and garlic. Toss the pasta around until itâ€™s coated (this is where you can add in the starchy pasta water to keep the pasta moist if it looks too dry). Add in the parsley and grated cheese, toss to combine and serve.",
